Everytime we want to look for information online or find a website about a specific subject we visit google, bin, yahoo or any other search website that give this service. For this reason I found interesting to learn and build my own sear engines.



The ***first version*** has an arry with a limited number of tags, for example videos, news, weather that can be search.
